\section*{Problem Description}
OpenCL is a recently defined and widespread open standard that will make the massive parallelism power now available in GPUs, but also newer CPUs (like the Cell B.E.) , more easily accessible to programmers.

This project involves porting an existing OpenCL snow simulation application to Open CL and comparing the implementation and benchmarks to those implemented in CUDA.\\[2cm]
