I would like to thank Dr. Anne C. Elster for heading the HPC-Lab and letting me work there. The lab provides a unique opportunity for students to work together and learn from each other, all in a great work environment.

I would also like to thank JÃ¸rgen Kvalsvik for providing valuable expertise on build systems, in particular CMake.
