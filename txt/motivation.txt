Rather than being a purely academic exercise, there are a few reasons why an OpenCL port of the Snow Simulator was desired. Of course, supporting more platforms is "better", but we had a few things in mind.
First of all, it paves the way for exploring GPGPU on mobile platforms. Even though Nvidia's Tegra chips are starting to get CUDA support, their market share on the mobile market is still small.[CITE?] An OpenCL version will enable us to use mobile graphics hardware such as e.g. ARM's Mali GPU.
Also, when this project was started, there were plans for the HPC Lab to build a display wall. Such a display is composed of several smaller screens, allowing for large screen size and resolution at a moderate price. We found that the best choice for a large multi-monitor setup like this would be AMD's Eyefinity. Running the Snow Simulator on AMD hardware would require an OpenCL port. This project may still happen at some point, but it is less of a priority since the Lab recently purchased an 85-inch 4k monitor, which fills the same role.
