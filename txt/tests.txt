Only expected and actual results in testing section!

1. Snow, terrain and skybox renders properly
2. Snow moves towards the ground when there is no wind
3. New snow spawns at top
4. Snow piles up 
5. No snow below ground level
6. When ground smoothing enabled, ground is smoothed (FAIL!)
7. Snow gets blown around by wind
8. Changing wind direction/speed causes a corresponding change in snow movement
9. Wind debug displays render correctly
10. Wind debug displays look "reasonable"/similar to CUDA version
11. Avalanche prediction looks similar to CUDA version 

Ground smoothing: Discovered too late, result seems to indicate indexing errors.
