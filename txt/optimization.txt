Use optimization flags when building kernel programs
	Discuss unsafe math optimizations
Async/OoO
	Should wind wait for snow or vice versa?
	Depends on problem size
	Circular dependencies = poop
	Possibly: barriers before and after: write windtex, write terrain
Workgroup sizes
	What does the literature say about this?
	Mostly arbitrary numerical constants
	Have OpenCL figure it out? Is such a thing even possible?
	Tune it based on the device in question?
Memory optimizations
	Hmmmmmm
	Array of Struct -> Struct of arrays?
	Scatter -> Gather?
	Sorting? Demonstrated speedup (ref. Vestre)
	Where is that damn article?
