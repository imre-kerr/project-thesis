\section*{Abstract}
The HPC-Lab Snow Simulator is a computationally demanding physics simulation program which runs on graphics hardware (GPGPU computing). The subject of this project is the porting of this program from the vendor locked-in CUDA API to an open one, OpenCL.

I also evaluate the performance of the resulting program using available profiling tools, and suggest changes which might be done to improve performance based on my findings.
